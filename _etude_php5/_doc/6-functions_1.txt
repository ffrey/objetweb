# scopes
global : can be declared inside function without having been declared in global scope previously...
! no assignment poss on "globalization" !

! static : only exists within scope of declaring function but retains value between repeated
 calls to the function !
(static $a; == static $a = 0 !!!)

! variables with diff scopes are different vars even though they have the same names !!!
== different namespaces...
static $a;
// do stuff on $a
global $a;
// deals with another $a !
