# PHP as a CGI Binary
: php is not configured as a webserver's module
  but as a command line binary !
  
user -> request to server -> request to php binary !

## specific risks
### accessing system files !
BUT no arg can be passed to php binary !

### user rights
as a module : php runs as webserver user
as cgi      : des directives specifiques servent à restreindre la 
liberté de mouvement des users php sur le serveur (force_redirect, doc_root,...)

### exposing code
risks that code be exposed through the web without being interpreted !
=> define doc_root + place php execs (as opposed to html templates ?)
outside of doc_root !
