# Streams
stream = resource object which exhibits a unified api (streamable behavior) 
for a series of resource objects such as filesytem types and network ones.
=> scheme://target
<= opened by fopen, fsockopen, etc. !

A stream is made up of : 
- a wrapper (scheme) : extra code to handle specific protocol (http, file, ftp, ...) or encoding.
! php wrapper : access to stdo/stdi

- pipeline(s)

- context : additional information for the given stream
ex : file => access mode (read, write, etc.)
     http => header
