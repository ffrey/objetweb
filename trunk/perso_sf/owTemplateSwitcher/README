# owTemplateSwitcher plugin (for symfony 1.2) #

This plugin supplies a front-controller <app>_design.php. Accessing the app through 
this controller, 2 sets of templates are allowed to co-exist. 

Every needed template will be looked for in this order :
    - inside the <public_directory>/_design_templates/ dir,
    - inside the classical symfony structure.

Basically, this allows the existence of second set of template for any given application. The aim is
The main aim is to ease co-working between designer and developer.

## Installation ##

  * Install the plugin

        symfony plugin:install owTemplateSwitcherPlugin
    
## Use ##

  * launch the task 'owTemplatesSwitcher::build-front <app>'
    This will create under your public directory :
        - a new controller '<app>_design.php',
        - a directory '_design_templates', containing the mirror of your
        <app> directory structure for templates only.
        
  * whenever you, or your designer, wants to override a template, all he 
  needs to do is create a file with the same name in the corresponding directory 
  of the '_design_templates' directory.
  
  * use <app>_design.php to view you app with the design template. Use 
  <app>_dev.php to view the 'classical' template.
